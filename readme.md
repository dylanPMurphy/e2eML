# End to End Machine Learning Project
This project was taken from O'Reilly Hands On with Machine Learning Chapter 2

### Packages Used
```
python3 -m pip install -U jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn
```

### Problem
Use California Census data to build a model of housing prices in the state

### Data

Split the state of California into blocks(smallest geographical unit for which Cenus Bureu publishes data).  Population size of each block is between 600-3,000 people.  We will refer to these blocks as districts.

Each district has:

- Population
- Median Income
- Median Housing Price


### Outcome

Model will learn from the sample to predict the meadian housing price in any district
 
### Steps

1. Look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning Alogorithms
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine-tune your model
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system
